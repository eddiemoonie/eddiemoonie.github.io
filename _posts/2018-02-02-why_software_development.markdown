Our world today is so connected with technology and it's only going to continue and advance. Just look at our phones. Over time, it went from being able to only make a phone call to being able to use the internet and applications all on just one mobile device. 

Although I'm not entirely new to coding, I did not have the passion and drive to pursue a developing career until recently. I dabbled with some introductory coding classes in college but only because they were required classes for my major and not because I wanted to learn. However, I came to a realization that there is always going to be a need for programmers and it's only going grow and influence the world. I want to be a part of the change that shapes the future.
