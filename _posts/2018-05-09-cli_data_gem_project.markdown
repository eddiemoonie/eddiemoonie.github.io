Finally after a month, my CLI Data Gem Project is complete. I was honestly terrified of the idea of creating an app from scratch so I kept on procrastinating. After a couple weeks went by with zero lines of code, I decided to just go for it and get started with this project. It was indeed challenging, but I was definitely overthinking prior to getting started. Even writing down couple lines of code is progress and helped envision how I wanted to design this application. It was definitely frustrating and stressful at times during the project but the satisfaction I got upon completion outweighed any negative feelings I had while working on this application. 

Here are some reminders for myself for future projects:

1. Just get started and start typing some code
2. Don't be afraid to ask for help (My biggest problem)
3. Keep grinding but take my time when I have to
